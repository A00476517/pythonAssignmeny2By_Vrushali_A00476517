# pythonAssignmeny2By_Vrushali_A00476517 - Cryptocurrency Data Visualization with Streamlit

This repository contains two Streamlit applications that provide insights and comparisons of cryptocurrency data fetched from the CoinGecko API.

## Installation

Before running the applications, you will need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Scripts Description
1) Crypto_Search_question1.py - This script visualizes the price trends for a selected cryptocurrency over the last year. It provides insights such as the highest and lowest price points within the specified timeframe.

2) Crypto_Comparison_question2.py - This script compares the price trends of two selected cryptocurrencies over a specified timeframe. It helps to visually analyze how different cryptocurrencies have performed relative to each other.

## How to Run the Scripts
# Running Crypto_Search_question1.py
To run the first script, open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run Crypto_Search_question1.py
```
The script will start a Streamlit server, and your default web browser should open automatically to display the app. If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually navigate to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.

## Running Crypto_Comparison_question2.py
To run the second script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run Crypto_Comparison_question2.py
```
Similar to the first script, this will start the Streamlit server, and the app should open in your browser at http://localhost:8501. If it does not, manually navigate to the address mentioned.

## Features
1) Interactive Selection: Users can select cryptocurrencies and time frames from the sidebar to tailor the visualizations to their preferences.

2) Data Insights: Both scripts calculate and display key statistics such as the highest and lowest prices and their corresponding dates.

3) Comparative Analysis: The second script allows for a comparative view between two cryptocurrencies, helping identify trends and anomalies over time.
